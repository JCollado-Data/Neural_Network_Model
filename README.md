# Neural_Network_Model

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analysis the AlphabetSoupCharity 'ASC' and determine which fund applicants will be successful and be best suited for ASC funds.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target for the model is the 'Is-Successful' column. 

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
The variables that we evaluated as features where the Type, Affilication, and Classification.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
We removed the EIN and Name.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
For the model I trained with 4 layers. I added more layers hoping to raise the accuracy for the model. I beleived add more layers would better filter the information and generate a better outcome.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
I was note able to improve the outcome with the mulitple tests I had performed.

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
I modifiy the droped columns, added more layers, adjusted the layers and neruons. 

## Summary
In summary I still have much to learn and practice with the nerual networks. I will continue to adjust the model and increase the accuracy.
